Doctor-patient-hospital record making app with privacy
considerations.

This app is a remodeling of the existing apps where 
consideration is given on why the need for personally identifiable
information (PII) is important and should be protected and even our medical
records comes under this category . Here , we enforce a public-private key setup
commonly used in the internet and provide the private key
to the patient only hence , without the knowledge of the patient ,
it is not possible to access his/her medical record . Also , there are permissions
asked when storing data that if the medical record of the patient can be used for research purposes or not.
Storage of data is also done using k-anonymity (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/privacy/reidentification/Sweeney_Article.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiws8XnjOn3AhWvRmwGHUjRD6UQFnoECAUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw07y7kA8XVAFi3B2WPFrzO0)

Future Scope:
A system which is scalable and maybe used for real time applications
and one which also handles the financial aspect of things . It is mainly aimed at 
making one system for all medical information even amongst different hospitals so that
the disbursement of information and the confusions in between ar reduced to a minimum and
a standard of medical information storage can be formed.
